# Daphne-s-Laurel
This art project tells the Greek myth about Apollo and Daphne. Users can move blocks in the pot and watch the ball bouncing. A flower will blow at the same time when the balls bounce. When a flower blooms completely, users can click the flower to listen a story of Daphne. There are four flowers in total, constituting the whole story about Daphne and Apollo. The bouncing balls symbolize the energy in the earth that nourishes the laurel. The laurel tree symbolizes Daphne because in the Greek myth Daphne in the end becomes a laurel.
